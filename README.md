# Project_3

# Background 
In 1984, Boston College's Doug Flutie threw a game winning Hail Mary aginast powerhouse Miami to put a wild end to an underdog story. This last second desperation attempt is thought to be one of the greatest unintentional marketing moments of all time.

In a study done by Harvard Business School Assistant Professor of marketing Doug J. Chung, it was found that on field success contributed to an 18.7% rise in applications and allowed schools to be more academically sellective. He mentioned that in order for schools to match these results they would need to either lower tuition by 3.8% or increase education quality through higher-quality faculty.


## Data 
Admissions data was taking from National Center for Eductional Statistcs (https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/use-the-data). Athletic Expense data was taken from College Athletics Financial Information (CAFI) Database. 

##Tableau Visualization Writeup
Using tableau for this project, the goal  was to analyze the data and create visualizations that shows correlation between championship and admissions for universities football program over the past two decades. The foundation for our project is based on the Doug Flutie Effect concept that says if a school wins a championship, that school would yield higher enrollment.  The process used for the visualizations is outlined below: 
·      Utilized Python to perform ETL on our raw datasets to generate multiple cleaned csv datasets
·      Imported cleaned datasets into tableau
·      Performed inner join on the School name from the Champion dataset and Admission dataset 
·      Created Champion vs Number of Applicants to analyze number of applications as it relates to the year the school won the championship. 
·      Created Applicants vs Number Admitted to assess correlation between these data points. 
·      Created interactive dashboard comprised of the two visualization.  The dashboard allow users to filter by school.
·      The dashboard was published via Tableau Public portal. 
·      Embed script for the dashboard from the Tableau Public Portal into our HTML code, for our hosted site.
